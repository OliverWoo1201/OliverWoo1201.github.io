## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, Part 1
This lab kicks off my coding journey. Driving into the basics, like learning how to make your computer do cool stuff. Picture yourself creating programs that calculate math problems or even say "Hello, world!" on your screen. It's like giving commands to your own digital minion!

Lab 1, part 2
In this part, the fun continues as you start adding more tricks to your coding toolbox. Ever wanted to make decisions for your program, like a choose-your-own-adventure story? You'll learn how with if-else statements! Plus, you'll loop through actions like a pro, making your programs dynamic and lively.

Lab 2, part 1
This lab introduces you to functions, which are like magic spells you can use over and over again. Imagine writing a tiny spell to solve a problem, then using it whenever you need to. It's like having a superpower in your code!

Lab 12, part 2
In this lab, you'll tackle a series of exciting challenges designed to test your newfound coding skills. From solving puzzles to simulating real-world scenarios, each challenge will push you to think creatively and sharpen your problem-solving abilities. Get ready to unleash your inner coding hero!
